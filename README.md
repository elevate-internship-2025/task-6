✉️ Task 6 — Contact Form With JavaScript Validation

This project implements a fully responsive, modern contact form with client-side validation for name, email, and message fields. 

The form checks user input in real time, shows inline error messages, prevents invalid submissions, and displays a success message when all fields are valid.
No backend or email-sending is used — this is a front-end only validation demo.
